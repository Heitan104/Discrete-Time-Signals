# Discrete-Time Signals

This repository contains my lab work for **ELE632 – Signals and Systems II**, a course focused on discrete-time signal analysis.

## Overview

Each lab uses **Python** in **Jupyter Notebooks** to explore various concepts related to discrete-time signals. The following libraries are used throughout:

- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) – for numerical operations  
- [`scipy`](https://scipy.org/) – for signal processing and analysis  
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) – for plotting and visualizations  

## How to Navigate

- Click on any **lab folder** to access its contents.
- Each lab includes:
  - A `.ipynb` notebook with code and analysis  
  - An accompanying `.pdf` file that summarizes results and explanations  

## Note

This project was completed as part of the **ELE632: Signals and Systems II** course at Toronto Metropolitan University.

Feel free to explore the labs and use them as a reference for learning more about discrete-time signals.
